## Overview

Number responses are used in the case where whole numbers are required. Decimal points will be ignored on the filling side so as to provide "automatic validation" that only whole numbers are entered. See examples:

## Creating a new Boolean response

Creating a new Number response works in the same way as other types:

1. Select "Add item" --> "Structure" --> "Group"
2. Select "Add item" --> "Inputs" --> "Integer"
