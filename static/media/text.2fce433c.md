## Overview  

Both text and text box return text (string) values. There is no length difference between the maximum text length for either of these. 

The only difference between them is how they appear on the filling side.

* **Text**: A single-line text field
* **Text box**: A multi-line text field

On the Composer side, they both look the same:
