# Basic Dialob Expression Language (DEL) operators

## Quick Summary

* Use operators to write logic rules
* DEL comparison operators: `=` , `!=` , `>`, `>=` , `<` , `<=`
* DEL keyword-based basic logical operators: `and`, `or`, `in`, `not in`

---

## Overview

Operators are symbols or words used to connect and evaluate two or more expressions to produce a result.  In Dialob, operators are used for writing the various logic rules (validation, visibility, and requirement).

DEL utilises several types of operators, including:

* Comparison operators
* Symbol-based logical operators
* Keyword-based logical operators

## Available operators

Below is a description of the basic DEL operators, which includes comparison operators, symbol-based logical operators, and keyword-based basic operators and their corresponding input types.

### Comparison Operators

* **=**: **Equal to** is valid with all default Response types

* **!=**: **Not equal to** is valid with all default Response types

* **>**, **<**: **Greater than** and **Less than** are valid with Integer, Decimal, Date and Time Response types

* **>=**, **<=**: **Greater than or Equal to**, and **Less than or Equal to** are valid with Integer, Decimal, Date and Time Response types

### Basic Logical Operators

* **and**: To combine a set of comparisons for evaluation as one entity

* **or**: To evaluate a set of comparisons as separate entities

* **in**: Checks if a given set of unique key(s) is found in the list to which it is compared. Valid Response types are Choice and Multi-choice

* **not in**: Checks if a given set of unique key(s) are found in the list to which it is compared. Valid Response types are Choice and Multi-choice
