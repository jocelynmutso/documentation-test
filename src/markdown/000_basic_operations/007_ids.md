## Changing IDs

Changing an ID will update all references to this ID automatically.

### Page ID

The Page ID can be changed by clicking the hamburger icon to the right of the Page name and selecting "Change ID" from the dropdown.


### Group ID, Question ID, Note ID

These can all be changed simply by clicking on their current IDs in the top left corner of the items and creating a new ID.


If a new ID conflicts with an existing one, the ID editing field will turn red, and a new ID will not be set until the naming conflict is resolved.
