## Overview  

Survey type uses radio buttons to collect input from users. Below is an example:

Survey types function a bit differently than other types.  For example, where a **Text** response type is located within a group which can contain any number of various response types, a **Survey** response type is the group itself. 

**A complete Survey response type is comprised of three parts:**

1. The **survey group**, which can be thought of the "question" itself.
2. The **survey options** which are created with a global or a local list. 
3. The **survey inputs**, which are text fields. 

In summary, one survey group is the equivalent of one survey "whole" encompassing these three elements. This example below illustrates the three cohesive elements of a Survey response type as they appear on the filling side.

## Creating a survey response

A Survey response type is created as a Survey Group or Survey Group (Vertical). 

To create a survey:

* Click "Add item"
* Select "Structure"
* Select "Survey Group" or "Survey Group (Vertical"
* Give your survey question a name by writing in the Survey Group label field
* Create a global/local list and attach it to the Survey group via the Survey Group-level hamburger icon + "Options" hamburger.
* Create survey inputs by clicking "Add item" in the bottom left of the Survey Group, and select "Survey Item". Write your text accordingly.

Follow the guide below for screenshots of this process.

## Several typical validations you will use

`question1 = "opt1"`  
Evaluates true when the return value of question1 is opt1.

`question1 in ("opt1", "opt3", "opt4")`  
Evaluates true when the return value of question1 is one of the following: opt1, opt3 or opt5 possible *Survey* key values.

`question1 not in ("opt1", "opt3", "opt4")`  
Evaluates true when the return value of question1 is NOT one of the following: opt1, opt3 or opt4 possible *Survey* key values.
