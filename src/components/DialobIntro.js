      <Typography paragraph>
      Dialob is a platform for creating and testing responsive dialogs and publishing them online. In the context of the Dialob platform, a dialog is both a form and a process. Creating with Dialob is a dynamic process wherein the word “dialog” is a representation of the constant communication between user inputs on the front-end and Dialob’s back-end processes, resulting in a constant “dialogue” between the system and the user throughout the creation process. In this way, Dialob constantly updates and saves user inputs on the back-end side and reflects those changes in near real time. The product and end result of the dialog process is a highly customizable form with validations, versioning, translation, and security built in, all tailored to a specific end-user requirement.
